			Anything that I've built before can be customized to suit your particular needs. You could, for 
			example, desire a different wood, or a different colour, or need to alter the dimensions.

			A brand new design is of course also possible. Typically, a new design would progress from 
			rough sketches to perhaps a 3D computer-generated drawing, to sometimes a scale model or 
			even a full-size mockup. There are many decisions to be made and the clients can be as 
			involved or as non-involved as they wish.

			The first step of getting a project booked into the shop schedule is making a deposit. This 
			needs to be topped up to 50 percent of the final price by the time construction begins. Once 
			the piece is finished, final payment is due prior to its leaving the shop.
