			<figcaption>
				Large curved pieces in solid wood are made by gluing staves together. Each edge is precisely angled so that, when glued, it forms a curved shape. This is called coopering. This is the way wooden barrels are made, and the way the ends were made for the bowed-front media cabinets.

				<figcaption>
					On the larger shapes, hand tools often need to be used as well. This dining table base is too thick for the jigsaw, so a Japanese hand saw is being used to cut its profile.

				<figcaption>
					Coopered pieces need to have the flats shaped on both the inside and outside so that a smooth curved surface is achieved. In this case a compass plane is being used.
