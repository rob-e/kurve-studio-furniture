itemTitle: "MM Elliptical dining table"
itemDescription: "The main idea here is to be able to sit anywhere at the table's edge without one's knees hitting the table's base. This was figured out, as with most of my pieces, with a full-size mock-up. Expands from 80\" all the way to 128\" while remaining absolutely stable. The leg design was later developed into the matching MM hall table for the same clients."
dimensions: "Length 80\" (104\" with leaf) &nbsp; Width 41\" &nbsp; Height 29\""
